Computational mathematics using R markdown
In this model, the triple (x(t), y(t), z(t)) denotes the proportion of a given population in the susceptible, infective, and re-
moved categories at time t ≥ 0. The model depends on two parameters β and γ and the initial values (x(0), y(0), z(0)) = (x0, y0, 1 − (x0 + y0)).
